running monitoring software on your network that 
A) logs traffic for later analysis, 
B) updates and enacts IP and other blocklists from a service, 
and/or C) looks for patterns in incoming traffic
and sends alerts if anything unusual is found,

 In general rather than trying to shove all traffic through Tor
 it's much safer to go trough other assets (cybercofee)
 and perform.

PROTECT YOURSELF: 
password rem@&1991 for tor (choose cybername spiderzweb eq) spidernet
 
 virtualbox vs vmware, which one is light weight, or better docker and linode?
 ETHICAL_TEST_HAT:
javascript auto click button from link visiting (fakebook) mimic server localhost:8080
